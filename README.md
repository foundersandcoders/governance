# Governance

Founders & Coders C.I.C. is a social enterprise whose main purpose is to maintain and develop our free coding programmes. 

We aim to open source our methods and our curriculum and to encourage others (and in particular our alumni) to replicate our model elsewhere.

As of February 2016, the company is no longer intending to contract directly with commercial clients, but will instead act as an employment agency and incubator, assisting alumni to find work or develop their ideas.
